# Rigged-Die
This program lets you roll a rigged die.
The way it works it that it takes the number of "sides" of the die, then adds first the numbr 1 that many times, then the number 2 the number of sides - 1, 3 sides - 2, etc.

For example, a 3 sided die would have three 1's, two 2's, and one 3.
a 6 sided die has six 1's, two 5's, three 4's, four 3's, five 2's, and one 6.

The default for this program is 6-side. To change tihs, simple change the arg used in createDie(sides) in the main function

For a 6-sided die, here are the odds for each roll:
- 1: 28.6%
- 2: 23.8%
- 3: 19.0%
- 4: 14.3%
- 5:  9.5%
- 6:  4.8%


It just makes it useful for when you want higher numbers to be increasingly more difficult to roll.
